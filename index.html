        <h1 class="head">HIV Diagnoses Continue to Rise in New York City for the Fourth Year in a Row</h1>
        <h2 class="subhead">
            On December 1, 2025, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene released its annual HIV Surveillance Report, showing that HIV diagnoses continue to rise across the city. The findings mark a significant reversal from the steady decline in HIV rates seen prior to 2020.

        <p><span class="location">NEW YORK CITY — </span>
            The annual HIV Surveillance Report released this month shows that New York City recorded 1,396 new HIV diagnoses across all five boroughs in 2024, a 6.2% increase from 2023. Every borough except Staten Island experienced an increase in diagnoses over the past year. Manhattan saw the largest year-over-year jump, with diagnoses rising 10%, while Staten Island recorded an 11.4% decrease between 2023 and 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite that single-year decline, Staten Island remains part of a broader post-2020 trend of rising HIV diagnoses citywide. While rates were declining prior to 2020, New York City has seen a 28.3% increase in HIV diagnoses between 2020 and 2024. Much of that growth has been concentrated in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Staten Island experienced the largest increase over the four-year period, with diagnoses rising 39.3%, followed by Queens at 38.4% and the Bronx at 33.6%.

            The data also reveal stark disparities across demographic groups. Latino men and women, along with transgender women of all races and ethnicities, have seen the most significant increases in HIV diagnoses. Between 2020 and 2024, diagnoses have risen 58.5% among Latina women, 40.8% among Latino men, and 38.6% among transgender women.

            Public health advocates say these trends reflect structural, cultural, and social barriers that limit access to prevention and care. Renanzo Williams, Intake and Homeless Outreach Coordinator at Start Corporation Youth Drop-In in New Orleans and former Sexual Health Service Navigator & Education Specialist at the Hetrick-Martin Institute in New York City with over seven years of experience in HIV testing, prevention, and treatment, says gaps in culturally responsive education have left many people without the information they need to protect themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
            “Unfortunately, a lot of Latino communities — especially gay and bisexual men in those communities — are still largely uneducated when it comes to sexual health, testing, and prevention,” Williams said. “When I was working in sexual health, I found that the language being used often didn’t fit clients’ experiences. Because of that, many didn’t realize they needed PrEP or, more recently, doxycycline.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Williams added that anxiety surrounding interactions with ICE based on actual or perceived immigration status can further discourage people from seeking testing or care, even when services are available.
        </p>

        <p>
            “There’s a real fear around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/04/us/ice-arrests-criminal-records-data.html">With ICE being rampant</a>, some people are scared that accessing testing or health care could put them or their families at risk, so they avoid it entirely, even if they are [documented or U.S. citizens].”
        </p>

        <p>
            For transgender women, Williams emphasized that intersecting forms of discrimination, particularly for Black trans women, create additional barriers that increase vulnerability to HIV. “Black trans women face so many different barriers,” Williams said. “First, being trans. Second, being Black. Third, being a woman. Each of those comes with stigma on its own, especially when you’re navigating health care. Even today, stigma still exists in so many fields.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite the availability of effective HIV prevention methods, Williams said education remains the most important step in preventing HIV. “There are so many preventative measures out there,” they said. “It really comes down to education and empowerment. At this point, it’s on us as communities to make sure we’re empowering the people who need it most.”
